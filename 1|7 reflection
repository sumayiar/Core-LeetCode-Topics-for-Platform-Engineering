Reflection:
After completing five Leetcode problems, I reviewed several essential programming concepts. Diving into medium level Leetcode problems made me realize that I have several concepts I have to learn.

My next steps are...
1. Keep going!
2. Refer to the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book I bought.
3. Watch YouTube videos on programming
